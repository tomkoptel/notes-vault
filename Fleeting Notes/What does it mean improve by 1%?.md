According to the graph, it is expected that we do improve by 37 times every year with at least 1% improvement every day.  The main problem with a statement is **what it is meant by 1% improvement**?

Improvement is a process of **increasing value**. If treated directly it means that any activity should be **quantified or measured**. For example, in drawing field we can improve by sharing work on social platform with others to see the amount of likes it collects.
