**Avoid tiny losse!** It is better to avoid and eliminate the amount of activities that hinder progress. 

For example, I do struggle with time management. I should avoid randomly opening youtube and watching videos. How to avoid that? Eliminate or reduce impact of the trigger. What are the triggers? The triggers are slow builds and boredom (aka cravings to 'procrastinate').
