Lighter values on the value scale called `tints`. Darker values on the value scale called `shades`. The midtones communicate values on the mid section of the value scale.

The place where light hits directly and with the most intensity called `highlight`. The area were light is permitted to be hit called `core shadow`. The transition from light to dark creates a line known as a `terminator`. 

The adjacent area were light prevented is called `cast shadow`. Within `cast shadow` exists darker zone - `occlusion shadow`. Both rely on shades to communicate the value.

When the light reflects from the adjacent surfaces it creates the `reflected highlight` - the zone with lighter value, even in areas we expect darker tone. The one uses middle values.

The values help us commuciate the location and the intensity of the light source in the scene. This allows us to create an illusion of shape by putting values to the basic forms (e.g rectangle, circle).
