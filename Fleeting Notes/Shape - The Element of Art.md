#drawing-essentials 
The process of creating shape requires us taking the shape and enclosing it. This results in creation of shape that can be either geometrical or organic. **Organic** can not be easily expressed with common heuristics and also known as freeform shapes. The **geometrical** shapes are formal like triangle or rectangle.

The shape is one of the tools that increases speed and improves the accuracy of drawing as we split the complex subject into simple shapes.
