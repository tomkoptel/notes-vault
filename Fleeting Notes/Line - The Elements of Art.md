The lines can convey the volume with a help of varying thickness also known as a `line quality`.

The lines allow to create us countour lines. The countour line allows us to define the object in space, its beginning and the end.

The `cross contour lines` used to convey the illusion of form. We can consider them as a guidelines the shape out the form into the space. They do cross over the contours of the object. The lines can be interpreted as a finger following the shape of the object. Just imagine touching the object and moving it down or to the side to feel out the dimension of the shape. The lines help us to communicate the form as we are drawing.
