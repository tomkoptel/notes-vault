tThe **weight** is a measure of impact the control point has on the curve.

The weight between 2 points A and B can be expressed with the **weighting function**. The closer we are to the point the higher weight and stronger impact. The simplest assumption is that weight changes proportionally to distance between points A and B.

P = A * (1-t) + B * t
P - on the linear segment
A - start point of the line
B - end point of the line
t - progress [0, 1]
